# Photography Backup

Docker container that uses [Borg](https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [rclone](https://rclone.org/) to make a full catalog backup.
In the current stage, the project is not meant to be a generic container for any kind of backup, even though contributions to make it happen
are welcomed!

## Requirements

* Docker to build a standalone container

## Usage

TODO

## Development

We accept external contributions even though the project is mostly designed for personal needs. If you think some parts can be exposed with a
more generic interface, feel free to open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/palazzem/photography-backup/issues) to discuss your suggestion.
